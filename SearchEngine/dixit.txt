Dixit   Sushi Go!  +1  Love Letter
jokris wrote:  We were playing some games today (30-35 year old friends).  However  Camel Up  was too many rules for some of them and we also felt we had to wait a bit too long for our turn. Las Vegas was not everyone's cup of tea either, slightly because of the downtime until your next turn.  Games that were successful and brought us a lot of laughs were:  * Cards Against Humanity * Telestrations * Going Going Gone * Diamant  Next time we will probably try Mysterium.  What other fun games would you recommend?  I guess I am looking for: * easy rules * fun * short downtime until your next turn * 4-5 players   If Camel Up had too many rules and seemed to have some length between turns, then I would steer clear of Mysterium. In my experience, it's a bit convoluted to explain to more casual-minded crowds.   Not saying it can't be done, but  Dixit  is a much better choice for the type of group you're describing. It moves a ton faster, less rules, and is more open-minded. Mysterium can  be a bit restrictive and you can get cards that just aren't useful.   I'd also second looking at  Incan Gold  (which someone else mentioned as Diamant), especially if you like a little push-your-luck, and  Sushi Go .
