That didn you like about the combat in it?   1. Randomness of dice rolls. 2. Luck of draw for ambush cards.   I am fine with some luck but it felt like if you drew really poorly and rolled badly then it didn matter what your strategy was. There were some things to offset this but overall It lacked the epic struggle I was looking for. Still a great game but did not scratch my pitch.  "}{"TeeJz": " Now about Scythe?

True, it is a little prices, but you definitely get your money's worth. Quality is top notch, solo play works well and overall replayabliity has been great for me so far.    Another really good one is  Must . Still a little on the prices side and you'd have to sang one from bay or the week market.

It very easy to pick up and play as well. The whole 'you can win by losing' thing is genius as unlike typical area control/war games, in Blood Age (and Rising Run too) you are ensure about whether attacking your opponents is a good idea or not - as they might be wanting you to attack them all along! Which leads to lots of mind games (not to mention the ensuing cursing and general clarity).  Foot if you want more of a traditional war game with dice rolls but with such a great deal of symmetry that some factions aren't even playing an area control game. It isn't actually that hard to teach as most of what players need to know is printed on their player mats. The biggest problem with Foot is that turns are long until players are experienced with the game.  And I'd definitely not consider Scythe as scratching the 'dukes on a map' pitch, it's very much a neuro engine builder with some combat tacked on (and players aren't encouraged to go out and fight their opponents either).  Heard good things about Words of Cells and Met as well but yet to try them.  Rising Run is also great, but it's more a game of diplomatic war like the Same of Thrones game, which might not be to everyone taste. You certainly have a lot less player agency compared to Blood Age or Foot. "}{"Jopo43": " BLOOD RAGE!!!!! "}{"pacman88k": " Of conflict is important,  His .  Of not,  Scythe .

In my experience, it's a bit convoluted to explain to more casual-minded crowds.   Not saying it can't be done, but  Visit  is a much better choice for the type of group you're describing. It moves a ton faster, less rules, and is more open-minded. Mysterium can  be a bit restrictive and you can get cards that just aren't useful.
