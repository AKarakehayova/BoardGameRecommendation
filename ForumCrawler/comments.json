What didnt you like about the combat in it?   1. Randomness of dice rolls. 2. Luck of draw for ambush cards.   I am fine with some luck but it felt like if you drew really poorly and rolled badly then it didnt matter what your strategy was. There were some things to offset this but overall It lacked the epic struggle I was looking for. Still a great game but did not scratch my itch.  "},

It's a tough sstem with a lot of guessing (you need to figure out what your opponent is likely to do and plan ahead even before that to have enough resources, but it's not at all random.    I dont know enough about the games already on your list to make a suggestion from those.   "},

True, it is a little pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth. Quality is top notch, solo play works well and overall replayabliity has been great for me so far.    Another really good one is  Dust . Still a little on the pricey side and you'd have to snag one from ebay or the geek market.  "},

I would hands down recommend  Blood Rage  as it's just such a finely tuned game.    If you are looking for more strategy and less luck. I recommend blood rage as well.  I also like zombicide: black plague but that adds more luck.  "},
{"vanquish7": " Would second Blood Rage or Root.  Blood Rage if you like crazy combos and bluffing. It very easy to pick up and play as well. The whole 'you can win by losing' thing is genius as unlike typical area control/war games, in Blood Rage (and Rising Sun too) you are unsure about whether attacking your opponents is a good idea or not - as they might be wanting you to attack them all along! Which leads to lots of mind games (not to mention the ensuing cursing and general hilarity).  Root if you want more of a traditional war game with dice rolls but with such a great deal of asymmetry that some factions aren't even playing an area control game. It isn't actually that hard to teach as most of what players need to know is printed on their player mats. The biggest problem with Root is that turns are long until players are experienced with the game.  And I'd definitely not consider Scythe as scratching the 'dudes on a map' itch, it's very much a euro engine builder with some combat tacked on (and players aren't encouraged to go out and fight their opponents either).  Heard good things about Lords of Hellas and Kemet as well but yet to try them.  Rising Sun is also great, but it's more a game of diplomatic war like the Game of Thrones game, which might not be to everyones taste. You certainly have a lot less player agency compared to Blood Rage or Root. "},

{"Denga": " Scythe is my favorite but definitely lower on the player conflict side (so freaking great though).  Blood Rage is probably my favorite conflict driven game like this because it\u2019s fun, has great cinematic moments, and plays quick.  If you want something heavier and more asymmetric then Cthulhu Wars is another good one. "},

In my experience, it's a bit convoluted to explain to more casual-minded crowds.   Not saying it can't be done, but  Dixit  is a much better choice for the type of group you're describing. It moves a ton faster, less rules, and is more open-minded. Mysterium can  be a bit restrictive and you can get cards that just aren't useful.   I'd also second looking at  Incan Gold  (which someone else mentioned as Diamant), especially if you like a little push-your-luck, and  Sushi Go . "},
