I already have a few games in mind. But still I would like some experts opinions. Thanks in advance. So I\u2019m looking for a game with strong mechanics, some complexity, time is not a problem (I\u2019m ok with the lengths of twilight struggle and SW Rebellion), and high replayability value. I\u2019m open to all kinds of games: card drafting, area influence/management, tile placing. Doesn\u2019t matter. So can you guys help me? Thanks everyone "

        "comment": " Hello, I'd greatly appreciate recommendations for games that have:   1) high levels of player interaction, contention, aggression AND  2) moderate to high levels of thematic immersion AND  3) strategy AND  4) minimal amounts of luck (some luck is OK) AND  5) direct competition and direct conflict AND 6) 2 hours or less to play (even with 4 people)    What I've realized is neither just Euro nor Ameritrash games are scratching the itch I have. I need qualities from both styles. I need the perfect (or close to perfect) strategy from Euros. I need the high level of interaction, aggression, and theme from Ameritrash games. Please help me in the quest to find games that fit all the qualities listed above.    What makes the list:  - Alien Frontiers - Twilight Struggle - Citadels - Small World  - A Brief History of the World  What does NOT make the list:   - Agricola is multiplayer solitaire. It is not interactive enough, and has no direct conflict.   - Tigris and Euphrates (not thematic enough)  - Twilight Imperium and Eclipse (too long, &gt; 2 hours)   - Troyes ...I have not played Troyes, but I do not think it would based on what I have read (not enough thematic immersion) and competition is not direct.

Las Vegas was not everyone's cup of tea either, slightly because of the downtime until your next turn.  Games that were successful and brought us a lot of laughs were:  * Cards Against Humanity * Telestrations * Going Going Gone * Diamant  Next time we will probably try Mysterium.  What other fun games would you recommend?  I guess I am looking for: * easy rules * fun * short downtime until your next turn * 4-5 players "

Star or Hero Realms is a nice deck builder that plays relatively quick.  Hanamikoji is, pound for pound, the best 2-player only game on the market and will be reprinted soon.  The Castles of Burgundy and Seasons, as previously mentioned, are best with 2.  I really love Kingdom Builder and Mystic Vale, both games that are fun with 2 and scale well going up to 4 players.  BattleCON is a fun take-that fighting game for 2 players.  Viticulture: Essential Edition plays great from 1-6. Honestly, this is as good with any count out there.  I'd love to chat more, especially if you see games I've reviewed that you want to see if they still hold up, etc.  "

Grand Austria Hotel  - This is in the same category as something like Seasons or Castles of Burgundy, where it plays more than two, but is best with two. This game is similar to Castles of Burgundy in a lot of ways, but has a completely different theme and nicer components.   Santorini  - The best abstract game I've ever played. This one has so much replayability with all the God powers and goes even more with the expansion. This one will have you thinking and thinking and will also be over with in about fifteen minutes. Onitama or Seikatsu are other good ones in this genre.   Too Many Bones  - This game scales very well, and is amazing solo, but will have you absolutely drooling over the component quality and will last many, many plays due to the insane level of difficulty coupled with the incredible depth of the characters.    Cosmic Run: Rapid Fire  - A really fun roll and write game (which is a hot genre right now) where you're traversing through space trying to get your three ships to their planets before your opponent. There is a lot to like about this fun little RaW. Castles of Burgundy The Dice Game is also a really good one in this genre.   The Ravens of Thri Sahashri  - A very unique and fantastical asymmetric 2p card game about...well you'll have to research for yourself. It's a very fun experience once you learn the ruleset.   Star Wars: Destiny  - My favorite game of all time. This game has the fun factor more than any other game I've ever played. You can just get two sets of the 2p starter set and have a blast for a while before you need to expand. It is a CCG-style game so you will be spending money buying boosters, but the game has a format geared towards newer players, so the barrier for entry isn't that steep.    Agility  - Very cute themed game about a dog show. There are more interesting decisions than you'd think in this little game, and I really enjoy it. It also has little dog-bone meeples. It's possibly less replayable than the others on this list, but is really fun. "

I am fine with some luck but it felt like if you drew really poorly and rolled badly then it didnt matter what your strategy was. There were some things to offset this but overall It lacked the epic struggle I was looking for. Still a great game but did not scratch my itch.  "

Tell me why this is a mistake    What makes it meaty to you despite its relatively low weight?   Remember that Weight and Depth are two very different yet often connected things.  Battle Line's weight might not be that high, because it is relatively simple to learn, but it's depth is notably great, which is what Mark meant by \"Meaty\", because there is a lot of depth to sink your teeth into.  Weight usually implies the amount of complexity that a game DEMANDS that you learn in order to play, while depth usually implies the amount of complexity that a game OFFERS UNDER IT'S SURFACE of standard gameplay.  Most of my favorite games have lower weight and higher depth. They allow you to focus on fewer things and have greater variables and possibilities for strategy and choices.  It's pretty ridiculous to dismiss lower weight games as being invaluable. "

I agree that not all of the \"weight\" ratings are a reflection of Rules Complexity (example: Go has 3.98) however, I think that it definitely reflects rules complexity more than actual depth much more often (90+% of the time in my opinion), because when people are actually quantifying a games \"weight\" on BGG, I don't think that they often asking themselves \"how much depth does this have.\" Instead, they are asking themselves \"How hard was this to learn.\"   Oh and, forgive me if I was unclear, I wasn't accusing you of treating simple games with depth as \"invaluable\" it was Adelin that was being dismissive of other's suggestions. I know you just wanted more information on Battle Line having Depth.  Thank you, friend   "

HIGH levels of interaction, NO luck, thematic immersion (of a sort because your character IS getting the stuffing beaten out of them or you're the one stuffin' the snot outta someone else), DIRECT conflict, and even your first game won't take more than an hour. It's a game that rewards multiple, multiple plays and your playing time will dwindle rapidly down to about 15-30min per match.  2) I'm going to get punched in the face for this but...  Alchemists . Once you've gotten through the rather lengthy rules explanation/understanding, my gaming group has not gone over 2hrs. Direct competition on so many fronts, no  real  luck whatsoever, HEAVY strategy (there are quite a few interesting paths to victory), and HIGHLY thematic (you'll actually feel like some wacky alchemist). It also has one of the most satisfying conclusions I've had gaming in a while: you feel a sense of resolve and finality when the game is over which is not something I have encountered in a lot of games which makes you feel that maybe a turn or two longer would've provided the same feeling. Are you getting the nebulous thoughts that I'm putting down?  Good luck! "

However  Camel Up  was too many rules for some of them and we also felt we had to wait a bit too long for our turn. Las Vegas was not everyone's cup of tea either, slightly because of the downtime until your next turn.  Games that were successful and brought us a lot of laughs were:  * Cards Against Humanity * Telestrations * Going Going Gone * Diamant  Next time we will probably try Mysterium.  What other fun games would you recommend?  I guess I am looking for: * easy rules * fun * short downtime until your next turn * 4-5 players   If Camel Up had too many rules and seemed to have some length between turns, then I would steer clear of Mysterium. In my experience, it's a bit convoluted to explain to more casual-minded crowds.   Not saying it can't be done, but  Dixit  is a much better choice for the type of group you're describing. It moves a ton faster, less rules, and is more open-minded. Mysterium can  be a bit restrictive and you can get cards that just aren't useful.   I'd also second looking at  Incan Gold  (which someone else mentioned as Diamant), especially if you like a little push-your-luck, and  Sushi Go . "

The whole 'you can win by losing' thing is genius as unlike typical area control/war games, in Blood Rage (and Rising Sun too) you are unsure about whether attacking your opponents is a good idea or not - as they might be wanting you to attack them all along! Which leads to lots of mind games (not to mention the ensuing cursing and general hilarity).  Root if you want more of a traditional war game with dice rolls but with such a great deal of asymmetry that some factions aren't even playing an area control game. It isn't actually that hard to teach as most of what players need to know is printed on their player mats. The biggest problem with Root is that turns are long until players are experienced with the game.  And I'd definitely not consider Scythe as scratching the 'dudes on a map' itch, it's very much a euro engine builder with some combat tacked on (and players aren't encouraged to go out and fight their opponents either).  Heard good things about Lords of Hellas and Kemet as well but yet to try them.  Rising Sun is also great, but it's more a game of diplomatic war like the Game of Thrones game, which might not be to everyones taste. You certainly have a lot less player agency compared to Blood Rage or Root. "

I'd rather play   Space Empires 4X   than Eclipse anytime; SE4X in 2 hours with 4 is a bit of a stretch but it's doable based on the scenario, and after a firm grasp of the (intuitive, streamlined and fully customizable) rules.  Also,   Dune   is pretty much exactly what you're looking for &amp; more - but the playtime (4 hours +). As someone correctly stated,  Dune is THE game for jerks .  A PnP of Dune (latest revised ruleset) beats Rex by a mile in my book (even if the treachery cards in the final score are a nice touch), but I get that if you're not into DIY, Rex may be cushy.  The same team that made Dune has also made  Cosmic Encounter , but it's more luck-filled and random. Quite nasty though.  Check also: -   Roborally   -   Colt Express   -   Room 24   -   Meuterer    Honorable mention,  Here I Stand , but the shortest 1532-43 scenario takes up to ~5 hours (6 players). The longest one... well :) "

Looks too good (modular board, dog eat dog atmosphere, impending doom)   There are a few ways to shorten Dominant Species to inside 2 hours, the easiest of which is to remove 4 cards that grant extra actions:  Omnivore Intelligence Parasitism Immigrants  (I think this improves the game anyway as there is less queuing for cards that could be annoyingly advantageous to some players not others).  The game plays perfectly well without those cards and in a shorter time frame with less AP potential. Winner.

I also like Cry Havoc, but like the (excellent)  Chaos in the Old World  it has very asymmetric factions, so you may want to be careful if you're worried about balance issues.  I see 'Nexus Ops' purely as an entry-level 'dudes-on-a-map' game, but it's probably the best. There's also 'Small World', which I consider very fun.  'Blood Wars' is a good choice if you enjoy drafting cards, but imho 'Inis' does a better job in that regard and 'Rising Sun' beats 'Blood Wars' in every other regard.   Clockwork Wars  is great, very underrated dudes-on-a-map game with secret, simultaneous unit deployment and high replayability.

I've played around 10 games of Kemet and haven't lost a single one but haven't really enjoyed them either because there's little tension.

The player who goes last has the biggest potential of running away with the game, this is a problem in all these types of games but in Kemet it really stands out in my opinion. The better people get at this game the more turn order matters.  So it's not like it's not random, it's just very exciting. Dice introduce tension, you don't know with 100% certainty you can win but you can still optimise. Also you have good and bad implementations of dice combat. If you have silly low percentages of hitting then I agree, dice lead to frustration but there are many games where the probabilities are really good depending on how wel you play. That's good fun because there's little to no frustration but still on occasion things go wrong and that keeps it tense (the whole dopamine thing), good tactics get rewarded but you never really know.

Well Said  Some of my favorite games use dice. (E.G  Troyes ) Perhaps I was too hasty to write off dice rolling for combat.   It sounds like If I decide on  Kemet  then I really need the expansion that resolves the turn over issues. It is also difficult to find around me. I may need to revisit this game at another time.   Clockwork Wars  Looks really good but It seems impossible to find a copy that isn't massively overpriced.   Blood Rage . I am leaning really heavily toward getting this one. I hesitate as I am not sure about depth.    Inis  &amp;  Cyclades  Played both these before like I mentioned and I really liked them. My hesitation is I can play them anytime at my local game store.    Cry Havoc  Looked good initially but I wrote it off as there seems to be a lot complaints about balance.    Nexus Ops  Is a mixed bag for me. I worry it might be too light and become boring quickly.   That's were I am at so far. Still have yet to look into other suggestions.          "

        "comment": " There's something to be said for dice based combat, the suspense and the excitement, where you try to mitigate dice rolls with sheer numbers.  Since you did ask for a \"My First Dudes on a Map\" game,  Nexus Ops  is the obvious choice especially if dice rolling appeals to you. Yes, it's OOP but it can be picked up fairly cheaply. It's not a meaty game, per se, but it plays so quick and so streamlined. With a modular board, it's one of the few DoaM games that's playable at 2p. It's one you might find hitting the table to kick off or end game night on a regular basis.   Risk Europe  - This is about as themeless as you can get with DoaM game. There is nothing here that draws you in. Playable with 3p but really shines at 4p. Nothing to write home about but the game play is, for lack of a better word, solid. It's cheap enough that it's worth picking up for when you're in the mood for a \"let's build some armies and attack some territories.\" It's not one you can necessarily play over and over again to refine your strategies for optimal play (which is what it sounds like you're after).    Mythic Battles: Pantheon  - This is more of a skirmish game. Although it lacks sheer numbers, since you're playing with a handful of units, it makes up for it with unit talents, powers, and clever gameplay. The dice base combat here is probably the best implementation ever. It's a shame that the only way to it for a fair price is when Monolith puts it up on Kickstarter. I do think Mythic Battles: Ragnarok is supposed to land on Kickstar this year. It's the same game system but uses Norse mythology instead of Greek mythology.   "

Personally my favorite on this list is  Cry Havoc  and it's one of my all-time favorite games. Like Root, Cry Havoc is HEAVILY asymmetrical and requires you to really get in depth with each faction and play to their strengths. You cannot play each faction the same and because of this it gets a bad wrap for being unbalanced but,  IT IS BALANCED . However you will need to invest time to learn each faction and their special abilities. Many of the detractors did not do this and that's why it's not nearly as popular as others on this list.  If that is not for you, then I would highly recommend  Blood Rage  over any of the others on your list. Blood Rage plays meh at 2, but amazing at all other player counts, and there are countless strategies to play. It's a ton of fun and one of the better dudes on a maps games out there. "

I see it more as a kids game and it attracts people that dislike dice but still want something wargamy.   878: Vikings \u2013 Invasions of England  is very good, very enjoyable experience      I don't mean to hijack this thread but I see you own the expansion. Do you think it fixes the issues with the base game? "

There seems to be a lot of good options and its tough to know what I will enjoy.   I caught bug after player  Root . While I enjoy the game It left me wanting more. It seems to suffer from balance issues and I am not a big fan of the combat. This is my opinion of course.   I have been considering the following games and would appreciate any input on the subject.   Kemet   Cyclades   Cry Havoc   Nexus Ops   I really appreciate the help guys.     I havent played Root.  What didnt you like about the combat in it?   1. Randomness of dice rolls. 2. Luck of draw for ambush cards.   I am fine with some luck but it felt like if you drew really poorly and rolled badly then it didnt matter what your strategy was. There were some things to offset this but overall It lacked the epic struggle I was looking for. Still a great game but did not scratch my itch.     Cry Havoc  will be more what you are looking for.  Avoid  Nexus Ops  "

I know people hate it when someone does this, but to prevent an embarrassing error, 'invaluable' does not, as one would think, mean \"without value\". It actually means \"so valuable that the value can't be measured\" in other words \"extremely valuable\" or \"can't go without it\". I apologize for being grammar police.  By the way, why  do  people do this? Because  it's worse when it happens in real life . They're trying to spare you that. "

It adds a bit of luck with a \"third player\" dice for role selection, but not too much luck to destroy the flow of the game. I highly recommend it.   Other games that we play:  Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation   Hive Pocket   Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective   Small World   Great suggestions on this thread! "

Thanks everyone   There are probably so many which fulfills those criteria that it's easier to do a search and find the first one by ranking that you can get hold of. Availability is probably the main issue for recommendations. ... or better yet. Find the nearest other board gamer in the area and see what's on the shelves in his/her collection.  Since you're Portuguese, maybe try some of  Vital Lacerda 's games. He has made a few games which have gotten very nice reviews. I've recently purchased  Vinhos Deluxe Edition  , but not had the chance to play it yet.  Other than that, I think you need to quantify \"some complexity\" and \"time is not a problem\" ... some games are *very* complex and others take well above 200 hours - but if you have the time it's often worth it.

Another game that i am surprised to not see mentioned is  Warhammer Underworlds Shadespire . Amazing skirmish game in my opinion and beats battlelore even if not exactly comparable but scratches the same itch. "

You may try  BattleLore (Second Edition)  or  War of the Ring (Second Edition)  for a 2-player only epic game.   However, I'd advise you to turn your attention to games that support more players but work greatly with 2, especially if those 2 players have the same experience with the game:    Mombasa    Mombasa perfect at 2!!!

        "comment": " Depends to whom I am playing with.  With my wife, beside  7 Wonders Duel , I play Reversi ( Othello ). It's a quick and tense abstract classic game that looks like Go but it's much more approachable. At first you feel just reacting and don't know what to do, but after just understanding (or reading a few paragraphs) of strategy and after a few games, things became very tense and the best part is that at the very end the board can completely change. It happens often that which of the last two possible moves you play be the difference between loosing and winning. So no time to be bored. Did I mentioned it's quick and compact?  With my little daughter I started playing  Forbidden Island  because she needs support. And she is captivated by the story. So much than when winning she must put all the figurines on and the helicopter card on the exit hexagon and to literally fly them of the table, and then she would destroy the island left behind with her hands. I also have Pandemic but it's too complicated for her.  With some male friends and my father I play  Backgammon  "
