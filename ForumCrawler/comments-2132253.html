						Hey guys/gals

						Haven't played any of those but Kemet seems to get high praise. I guess part of it would be what you are looking for? Area control? Dice/No Dice?

						

						

						If it’s your first one, Nexus Ops.  It’s widely seen as the essence of the genre and simple mechanics.  Then branch out to all the others.
		

						

						How about Scythe?  Although eng bldg game does have combat and cool minis 

						From your list, I would choose Kemet. But you're missing out on the greatest area control game ever... 

						

						I dont think you can wrong with Rising Sun as a dudes on a map game.  Also, the combat system is unique and definitely not random.  It's a tough sstem with a lot of guessing (you need to figure out what your opponent is likely to do and plan ahead even before that to have enough resources, but it's not at all random.  

						

						

						 Carcassonne. 

						

						

						

						

						

						Would second Blood Rage or Root.

						BLOOD RAGE!!!!!
		

						If conflict is important, 

						Don’t forget 

						If you want a FUN "dudes on a map" game try Smallworld. Or if you want a real "dudes on a map" game try a wargame like Battle of the Bulge: Celles, see Stuka Joe's excellent video.

						Scythe is my favorite but definitely lower on the player conflict side (so freaking great though).  Blood Rage is probably my favorite conflict driven game like this because it’s fun, has great cinematic moments, and plays quick.  If you want something heavier and more asymmetric then Cthulhu Wars is another good one.
		

						Of those you listed, Kemet is best by a mile.
