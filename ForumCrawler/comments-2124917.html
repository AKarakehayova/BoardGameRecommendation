						We were playing some games today (30-35 year old friends).

						

						

						Around here, the 5P games that would come out would be (in no particular order):

						 

						

						King of Tokyo / King of New York

						

						Looks like you should try

						

						

						

						

						

						

						Azul - 4 players

						I will also get behind Sushi Go Party. 

						

						Hi, the first one I thought of while reading you was King of the Dice, maybe a dexterity game like Junk Art, I'm waiting for Men at work, it's a game like that. Dungeon Raiders could be fine for you.
